## UAE Government Finance Statistics Forecasting

This repository contains a comprehensive forecasting system for the United Arab Emirates Government Finance Statistics (GFS), based on publicly available Ministry of Finance data. The project provides predictive analytics for key financial indicators such as Total Revenue, Total Expenditure, and their subcategories including taxes, social contributions, grants, compensation of employees, and social benefits.

The system implements multiple time series forecasting techniques, including ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing (ETS), Seasonal Naive, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and LSTM neural networks. It also combines the best-performing models into a hybrid forecast to get best model accuracy. Users can interactively query historical data or generate forecasts for specific quarters and variables, with results displayed in both tabular and visual formats using Matplotlib and Plotly.

This tool is designed to support data-driven decision making and budgeting analysis by providing insights into government finance trends and future projections.
